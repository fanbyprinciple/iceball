## How to start with p5js boilerplate
1. [Download](https://github.com/bsplt/p5js-boilerplate/archive/master.zip) or clone the git.
2. Write your Processing code into `/js/main.js`. You can follow the p5js [workflow](http://p5js.org/get-started/) or write Javascript your style.
3. Change `index.html` to your requirements (or do nothing to it). You can write HTML as you like and still have the Processing sketch in the background.
4. Launch your `index.html` and have fun.
